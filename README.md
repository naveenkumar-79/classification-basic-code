## 🌸 Iris Flower Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

A simple yet effective machine-learning project that uses the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to classify Iris flower species based on sepal and petal measurements.
This project demonstrates essential steps in a typical ML workflow — data loading, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and prediction.

## 📌 Project Overview

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset commonly used for multiclass classification tasks.
It contains 150 samples from three species:
Iris Setosa
Iris Versicolor
Iris Virginica

## Each sample includes four features:
Sepal Length
Sepal Width
Petal Length
Petal Width
The goal is to train a KNN classifier to correctly identify the species based on these features.
## 🧠 Features of This Project

✔ Loads the Iris dataset
✔ Splits data into training and testing sets
✔ Uses KNN classifier for multiclass classification
✔ Evaluates model using accuracy score
✔ Predicts the species for custom input
✔ Simple and easy-to-understand implementation
